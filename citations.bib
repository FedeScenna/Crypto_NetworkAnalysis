abstract="We introduce captcha, an automated test that humans can pass, but current computer programs can't pass: any program that has high success over a captcha can be used to solve an unsolved Artificial Intelligence (AI) problem. We provide several novel constructions of captchas. Since captchas have many applications in practical security, our approach introduces a new class of hard problems that can be exploited for security purposes. Much like research in cryptography has had a positive impact on algorithms for factoring and discrete log, we hope that the use of hard AI problems for security purposes allows us to advance the field of Artificial Intelligence. We introduce two families of AI problems that can be used to construct captchas and we show that solutions to such problems can be used for steganographic communication. CAPTCHAs based on these AI problem families, then, imply a win-win situation: either the problems remain unsolved and there is a way to differentiate humans from computers, or the problems are solved and there is a way to communicate covertly on some channels.",

abstract = {In online handwriting recognition the trajectory of the pen is recorded during writing.
Although the trajectory provides a compact and complete representation of the written
output, it is hard to transcribe directly, because each letter is spread over many
pen locations. Most recognition systems therefore employ sophisticated preprocessing
techniques to put the inputs into a more localised form. However these techniques
require considerable human effort, and are specific to particular languages and alphabets.
This paper describes a system capable of directly transcribing raw online handwriting
data. The system consists of an advanced recurrent neural network with an output layer
designed for sequence labelling, combined with a probabilistic language model. In
experiments on an unconstrained online database, we record excellent results using
either raw or preprocessed data, well outperforming a state-of-the-art HMM based system
in both cases.},
